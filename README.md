* MyArrayList is a simulation of Arrays, it contains several basic functions.
* 
* ## A short summary of Array and Linkedlist
* ### Common and difference:
* Array is a contiguous list in both logical and physical memory address
* Linkedlist may not be contiguous in physical address but contiguous in logical

* ### Operation : 
* Array list is easy to search and get value just by using it's index, and less efficiency if the array list is not full.
* Array list also requies an expand operation if the space is not enough where linkedlist do not need.
* Linked list is easy to insert and delete, each time to delete or insert a node, just redirect the pointer.
